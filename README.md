# Monty Hall game statistical analyser

## Author

Virgil Ribeyre

## Description

This little JavaFX application allows you to simulate a number of "games" of the famous Monty Hall Game (more info [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem)) for a player who changes them mind in the middle of the game and for one who stays consistent. Therefore, it shows you two pie charts to see the success rate of both players for the same number of iterations.
